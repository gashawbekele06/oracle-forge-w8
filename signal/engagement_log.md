| 2026-04-11 | Kirubel | r/LocalLLaMA | u/matt-k-wong asking about model size | Clarified: Llama 3.3 70B via Groq. Explained structured docs (tables + code) outperform prose even at 70B -- same info as prose failed injection test, as table passed immediately. Invited comparison across param counts. | [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1siqbda/i_kept_running_into_cases_where_retrieval_was/) |
| 2026-04-11 | Kirubel | r/LocalLLaMA | OP of "Curated 550 Free LLM Tools" post | Substantive comment: flagged genai-toolbox (MCP Toolbox) as our standard interface layer, asked community about OSS for ill-formatted join key resolution (PG int ↔ MongoDB "CUST-00123"), suggested DAB + promptfoo + langsmith additions, offered to PR. | [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sigg35/curated_550_free_llm_tools_for_builders_apis/) |
| 2026-04-13 | Kirubel | r/LocalLLaMA | Follow-up on own r/LocalLLaMA injection-testing post | Closed the loop on injection testing at sub-8B model scale: 21/21 pass on llama-3.1-8b-instant, confirming structured docs > raw context length is model-size-agnostic. Linked INJECTION_TEST_LOG.md on repo for verification. | [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1siqbda/i_kept_running_into_cases_where_retrieval_was/) |

| 2026-04-12 | Meseret | The Silent Killer of AI Data Agents | The AI Agent Index (19 followers) | "Silent failures are genuinely harder to handle than loud ones. Confident wrong answers erode trust without leaving a clear signal to debug. The No data found problem usually traces back to schema mismatches or query construction issues that only surface at the edges of real-world data." | [link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/silent-killer-ai-data-agents-how-were-engineering-around-bolled-rsg8f ) |

## Community Intelligence

_External responses or findings that changed the team's technical approach._

| Date | Source | Finding | Impact on Build |
|------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 2026-04-11 | r/MachineLearning | Posting blocked: account too new or karma too low for r/MachineLearning. Pivoted to r/learnmachinelearning | Adjusted community targeting. r/learnmachinelearning has lower barrier, still relevant audience. Will build karma for r/MachineLearning access in Week 9. |
| 2026-04-11 | u/matt-k-wong (r/LocalLLaMA) | Validated "longer docs = lower quality" as universal LLM property; linked our injection test approach to Karpathy's wiki thesis | Reinforced Mikias's table-heavy, Q&A-anchored KB format; 21/21 injection test pass on llama-3.1-8b-instant (Apr 12) is a direct outcome |
| 2026-04-13 | DAB official channels (GitHub + leaderboard site) | No official DAB Discord exists. UC Berkeley EPIC Lab + Hasura PromptQL route community through GitHub issues only | Cohort community strategy redirected to Hugging Face / EleutherAI / LlamaIndex Discords per Practitioner Manual guidance. Three Discords joined. |
| ~~2026-04-13~~ | ~~u/Far-Comparison-9745 (r/learnmachinelearning)~~ | ~~REMOVED: This was Kirubel's own second Reddit account, not external community engagement~~ | -- |
| 2026-04-13 | @matanzutta on X (replied to Kirubel's Domain Knowledge Trap reply under @ashpreetbedi/Dash v2) | "the gap between what the schema says and what the business actually means is where most agent queries go wrong" — verbatim restatement of our Domain Knowledge thesis from a non-coordinated practitioner | **Strongest external validation in portfolio so far.** Confirms our framing lands with practitioners outside the cohort. Cite in final engagement summary and Week 9 X content. |
